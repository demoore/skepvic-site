    <h2>Why Join</h2>

    <p>
        The purpose of this club is to promote scientific inquiry and critical thinking. As such, we are open to
        discussing and investigating any skeptically relevant topic which our members find interesting. Club members are
        encouraged to practice critical thinking skills and look for actual scientific evidence for and against any
        claims they come across.
    </p>

    <p>
        The environment we aim to create is one in which people feel comfortable asking questions when they are unsure
        of whether or not they should accept a position, claim, or belief. Everyone is wrong sometimes and our goal is
        not to mock people for making mistakes or being fooled into believing silly things. That said, as skeptics, we
        also don't pretend to validate bogus claims in order to spare people's feelings. If a topic is being discussed
        by
        the group, it will be discussed openly and honestly. This will sometimes mean listening views that may oppose
        your own. Sometimes these discussions may even get pretty heated. We see this as a good thing. Skepticism is
        about changing your mind when good evidence is shown and a good skeptic knows when to admit they were wrong.

    </p>

    <p>
        If you have ever been curious about investigating the actual science behind topics such as those below, then
        this club may be for you.
